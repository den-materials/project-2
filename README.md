#### Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Node app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but we'll give you the tools over the next couple weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

#### Requirements

Your app must:

* **Have at _least_ 2 models** (more if they make sense) – one representing someone using your application, and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
* **Have at _least_ 2 software unit tests** using Mocha and Chai
* **Interface** with a 3rd Party Web API of your choosing
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* **Utilize Mongo to create a database structure** and interact with your JSON-like data
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public

---

#### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
* **Wireframes of your app**, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
* A link in your ``readme.md`` to the publicly-accessible **user stories you created**

---

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _to-do lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
* Keep it **small**.  What is the **minimum viable product** for your project?  That is, what is the shortest way to hit all the requirements without any bells and whistles?  Bells and whistles can be added later.
* Make sure your **API works**.  API work can easily take up the whole project week if you let it.  Again, what is the minimum you need to satisfy the requirements?  Abandon any APIs that do not give you that in a reasonable amount of time.
* Make sure **Passport works**.  A lot of steps are necessary to make signup, login, and logout work, and some of them are hidden in Passport's code.
* **Stick with your squad.**  There is strength in numbers, and 3 or 4 people working on a problem together are probably more effective than 1 person working alone.
* Get **Heroku working early**.  Even if it is just a "Hello World", that is a great start.  Getting a deployed Heroku project is hard, so don't put it off until the then.

#### Potential Project Ideas

##### Cheerups
The world is a depressing place.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - happy little quips to brighten other people's' days. Cheerups will be small - limited to 139 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

##### Bookmarket
You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep.

But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

##### Photo sharing app
Users will be able to register and create albums and photos. Albums and photos will need to be named and described by their owners. Users will be able to view other user's' albums. Maybe users can comment on photos, or either up/down vote them.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation

There are several requirements in the Project 2 rubric. Your instructors will score each of your requirements below using this scale:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!


* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Professional Development__: Did you demonstrates ability to communicate and collaborate with others in the classroom and/or on a team? Did you treat your peers, teammates, instructors with respect, make and follow agreements, and maintain a growth mindset?

#### Your First Stand-up

After you have finished your Trello and README, circle up with your squad and show them your project idea.

In order to be approved, your squadmates' projects must have:

- A Trello board with all user stories
    - All user stories must have sizes
    - All user stories must be from the user's perspective
    - All user stories put together must satisfy all requirements on the rubric
- A README for the project
    - The README must be on GitHub
    - The README must have a basic description of the project
    - The README must specify what API you are planning on using

Give your squadmates at least two "glows" (something you really like) and two "grows" (something you'd like them to improve).  In order to be "approved", all projects must have these points, so make sure your squadmates' covered them all.

#### Your Second Stand-up

After all squadmates have had a chance to polish their project planning, they will present their ideas again.  This time, make sure all bullet points above are hit.  If they are, send your project Trello and README links to the instructors.  If they are not, polish up those last few bits before sending the links to the instructors.

Finally, tell your squad:

- What you have done
- What you will do
- Any blockers

And try to show your squadmates as much as possible (Trello, Live app, Code -- showing is way better than telling).
